A set of tools made in python for creating and managing a media library of movies and tv shows

I'm currently working on making a django application to actually browse/edit my library, so this repo 
has the source for both the utilities used to scrape/generate data and the source for the django ui.

NOTE: I don't know django. I'm still learning.
